What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a reposity, you create an imaginary file that you can created changes and after you feel comfortable
with the changes, can save them to the working directory. Allows you to edit your work without causing permanent changes.
Allows you to track your work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the intermediate area between the working directory and git repository. 
You can add files that are found in the wokring directory and once changes have been made, you can commit those changes to the Git repository.
It allows you to have more contorl over the edit and changes you make to files before commiting anything and making it part fo the repo.
